# ###
# This example shows how to use the orka-full Task to create a single macOS VM
# with an assigned system serial number (fake serial number in this example).
# The script provided in the params will be executed inside the VM.
#
# You will need to have a secret containing the Orka credentials as well as a
# secret containing the VM SSH credentials as described in the README.
