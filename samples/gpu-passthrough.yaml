# ###
# This example shows how to use the orka-full Task to create a single macOS VM
# that uses the host's GPU. GPU Passthrough needs to be enabled in the Orka cluster.
# The script provided in the params will be executed inside the VM.
#
# You will need to have a secret containing the Orka credentials as well as a
# secret containing the VM SSH credentials as described in the README.
