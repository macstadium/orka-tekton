# ###
# This example shows how to use the orka-full Task to create a single macOS VM
# with custom vm-metadata. For info on retrieving the VM metadata, refer to
# https://orkadocs.macstadium.com/docs/retrieving-vm-metadata
# The script provided in the params will be executed inside the VM.
#
# You will need to have a secret containing the Orka credentials as well as a
# secret containing the VM SSH credentials as described in the README.
